    explanation: According to [[Model Description Section 2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09778.pdf)
    value: They filter out low-quality data, they employ a combination of rule-based
      and machine-learning-based methods. Specifically, they use multiple models
      to score the content, including language models, text-quality scoring models,
      and models for identifying potentially offensive or inappropriate content.
      They also manually sample texts from various sources and review them to ensure
      their quality. To further enhance the quality of our data, they selectively
      up-sample data from certain sources, to ensure that our models are trained
      on a diverse range of high-quality content.
