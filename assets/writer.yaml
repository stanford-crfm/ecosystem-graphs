  modality: Text; Text
  analysis: According to Writer's testing, Palmyra-Med averaged 85.9% across all medical benchmarks, beating the runner-up model by almost two percentage points. Palmyra-Fin was tested using the CFA Level III exam and scored 73% on the multiple-choice section, outperforming the average passing score of 60% and demonstrating its financial expertise.
  size: Palmyra-Med-70b and Palmyra-Fin-70B (The '70b' likely refers to the number of model parameters in billions. Hence it is suggested that each model has about 70 billion parameters. Further detail about model sparsity is unknown.)
