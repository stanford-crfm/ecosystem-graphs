  name: Poseidon
  organization: Seminar for Applied Mathematics, ETH Zurich, Switzerland & ETH AI Center, Zurich, Switzerland
  description: Poseidon is a foundation model for learning the solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). It is based on a multiscale operator transformer and implements a new training strategy that leverages semi-group properties of time-dependent PDEs for scalable training data. Poseidon is pretrained on a large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics and exhibits a high level of performance across multiple downstream tasks. It also shows remarkable generalizability to new physics that did not feature during pretraining.
