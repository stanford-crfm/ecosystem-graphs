  name: GPT-3 dataset
  organization: OpenAI
  description: The GPT-3 dataset is the text corpus that was used to train the GPT-3
    model. Information on the GPT-3 dataset is limited to discussion in the paper
    introducing GPT-3 [[Section 2.2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#subsection.2.2).
  created_date:
    explanation: The date for the public announcement of GPT-3. The GPT-3 dataset
      didn''t have a specific release date separate from the model [[Open AI Blog
      Post]](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/).

  size: 570 GB
  sample: []
  analysis: The GPT-3 paper, which also introduces the GPT-3 dataset, provides a
    limited analysis on the GPT-3 dataset, reporting the dirtiness of the dataset
    after the it was filtered for text occurring in common benchmarking tasks. The
    authors report that "as the dataset becomes more contaminated, the variance
    of the clean over all fraction increases, but there is no apparent bias towards
    improved or degraded performance" [[Appendix C]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#appendix.C).
  dependencies: [WebText]
  included: The dataset is composed of several NLP corpora including Common Crawl
    (filtered, 60%), WebText2 (22%), Books1 (8%), Books2 (8%), Wikipedia (3%) [[Section
    2.2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#subsection.2.2).
  excluded: The Common Crawl dataset was processed using a classifier that kept
    high quality documents and filtered low quality documents. WebText was used
    as a proxy for high quality documents [[Appendix A]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#appendix.A).
  quality_control: In addition to excluding low quality documents from the Common
    Crawl dataset, the authors fuzzily deduplicated documents within each dataset,
    by removing documents that have high overlap with each other. The same procedure
    was followed to fuzzily deduplicate WebText from Common Crawl [[Appendix A]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#appendix.A).
    Text occurring in benchmark datasets were also partially removed [[Appendix
    C]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#appendix.C).

      The total size is unknown, but the largest CLIP model is a
      a combination of 63M-parameter (dense) text encoder and a 307M-parameter
      vision encoder.
  dependencies: [CLIP dataset]
  training_emissions: unknown
  training_time:
    explanation: "The exact training time of CLIP depends on the vision and language\
      \ encoders used: \"The largest ResNet model, RN50x64, took 18 days to train\
      \ on 592 V100 GPUs while the largest Vision Transformer took 12 days on 256\
      \ V100 GPUs. For the ViT-L/14 we also pre-train at a higher 336 pixel resolution\
      \ for one additional epoch to boost performance ... Unless otherwise specified,\
      \ all results reported in this paper as “CLIP” use this model which we found\
      \ to perform best\" [[CLIP paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf).\n\
      Using the GPU Time method outlined in the [[OpenAI AI and Computer Blog]](https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/#addendum),\
      \ we can compute the training time in petaflop/s-day for RN50x64 and ViT-L/14\
      \ with the following equation: Number of GPUs * (peta-flops/GPU) * days trained\
      \ * estimated utilization. We will assume that estimated utilization is 33%,\
      \ following [[OpenAI AI and Computer Blog]](https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/#addendum).\
      \ The specific V100 GPU used isn't cleared from the paper, so we will assume\
      \ that V100 PCle was used. The V100 PCle GPUs have a single precision performance\
      \ of 15.7 teraflops [[V100 Datasheet]](https://images.nvidia.com/content/technologies/volta/pdf/volta-v100-datasheet-update-us-1165301-r5.pdf),\
      \ which is equal to 15.7 / 1000 = 0.0157 petaflops.\nFollowing the formula\
      \ \"Number of GPUs * (peta-flops/GPU) * days trained * estimated utilization\"\
      , we can compute the petaflop/s-day for RN50x64 as follows: 592 * 0.0157 *\
      \ 18 * 0.33. Similarly, for ViT-L/14, we can compute the same as: 256 * 0.0157\
      \ * 12 * 0.33. Adding the two, we estimate the total training time as 71.12\
