    The GPT-3 paper, which also introduces the GPT-3 dataset, provides a limited
    analysis on the GPT-3 dataset, reporting the dirtiness of the dataset after
    the it was filtered for text occurring in common benchmarking tasks.
    The authors report that "as the dataset becomes more contaminated, the
    variance of the clean over all fraction increases, but there is no apparent
    bias
    towards improved or degraded performance"

      There is no known license specific to the GPT-3 dataset, however,
      the governing organization, OpenAI, licensed GPT-3 to Microsoft, which
      makes it likely that the GPT-3 dataset was also licensed
      [[OpenAI Blog Post]]
      (https://openai.com/blog/openai-licenses-gpt-3-technology-to-microsoft/).
  included: >
    The dataset is composed several NLP corpora: Common Crawl (filtered, 60%),
    WebText2 (22%), Books1 (8%), Books2 (8%), Wikipedia (3%)
    [[Section 2.2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#subsection.2.2).
  excluded: >
    The Common Crawl dataset was processed using a classifier that kept high
    quality documents and filtered low quality documents. WebText was used as a
    proxy for high quality documents
    [[Appendix A]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#appendix.A).
  quality_control: >
    In addition to excluding low quality documents from the Common Crawl
    dataset, the authors fuzzily deduplicated documents within each dataset, by
    removing documents that have high overlap with each other. The same
    procedure was followed to fuzzily deduplicate WebText from Common Crawl
    [[Appendix A]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#appendix.A).
    Text occuring in benchmark datasets were also partially removed

  modality: Text (English) and Image
  size:
    value: unknown
    explanation: >
      The total size is unknown, but the largest CLIP model is a
      a combination of 63M-parameter (dense) text encoder and a 307M-parameter
      vision encoder.
  analysis: The model was evaluated on standard vision datasets (e.g. CIFAR10, ImageNet)
    and showed robust state of the art results.
  # Construction
  dependencies: [CLIP dataset]
  training_emissions: unknown
  training_time:
    value: 71.12 petaflop/s-day
    explanation: >
      The exact training time of CLIP depends on the vision and language
      encoders used: "The largest ResNet model, RN50x64, took 18 days to train
      on 592 V100 GPUs while the largest Vision Transformer took 12 days on 256
      V100 GPUs. For the ViT-L/14 we also pre-train at a higher 336 pixel
      resolution for one additional epoch to boost performance ... Unless
      otherwise specified, all results reported in this paper as “CLIP” use this
      model which we found to perform best"
      [[CLIP paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf).

      Using the GPU Time method outlined in the
      [[OpenAI AI and Computer Blog]](https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/#addendum),
      we can compute the training time in petaflop/s-day for RN50x64 and
      ViT-L/14 with the following equation: Number of GPUs * (peta-flops/GPU) *
      days trained * estimated utilization.
      We will assume that estimated utilization is 33%, following
      [[OpenAI AI and Computer Blog]](https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/#addendum).
      The specific V100 GPU used isn't cleared from the paper, so we will assume
      that V100 PCle was used. The V100 PCle GPUs have a single precision
      performance of 15.7 teraflops
      [[V100 Datasheet]](https://images.nvidia.com/content/technologies/volta/pdf/volta-v100-datasheet-update-us-1165301-r5.pdf),
      which is equal to 15.7 / 1000 = 0.0157 petaflops.

      Following the formula "Number of GPUs * (peta-flops/GPU) * days trained *
      estimated utilization", we can compute the petaflop/s-day for RN50x64 as
      follows:
      592 * 0.0157 * 18 * 0.33.
      Similarly, for ViT-L/14, we can compute the same as:
      256 * 0.0157 * 12 * 0.33.
      Adding the two, we estimate the total training time as 71.12
      petaflop/s-day.

    This is because our safety assessment demonstrated a high need for task
    specific testing especially given the variability of CLIP’s performance
    with different class taxonomies. This makes untested and unconstrained
    deployment of the model in any use case currently potentially harmful.

    Certain use cases which would fall under the domain of surveillance and
    facial recognition are always out-of-scope regardless of performance of the
    model. This is because the use of artificial intelligence for tasks such as
    these can be premature currently given the lack of testing norms and checks
    to ensure its fair use.
