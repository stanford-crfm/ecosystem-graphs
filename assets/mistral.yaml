  name: Mistral NeMo
  organization: Mistral AI, NVIDIA
  description: The Mistral NeMo model is a state-of-the-art 12B model built in collaboration
    with NVIDIA, offering a large context window of up to 128k tokens. The model
    is suitable for multilingual applications and exhibits excellent reasoning,
    world knowledge, and coding accuracy. It's easy to use and a drop-in replacement
    in a system that uses Mistral 7B. The model uses a new tokenizer, Tekken, based
    on Tiktoken, which is trained on over 100 languages. It compresses natural language
    text and source code more efficiently than previously used tokenizers.

  model_card: unknown
  modality: text; text
  analysis: The model underwent an advanced fine-tuning and alignment phase. Its
    performance was evaluated using GPT4o as a judge on official references. It
    was compared to recent open-source pre-trained models Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3 8B
    regarding multilingual performance and coding accuracy. Tekken tokenizer's compression
    ability was compared with previous tokenizers like SentencePiece and the Llama
    3 tokenizer.
