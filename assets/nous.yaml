  name: Genstruct
  organization: Nous
  description: Genstruct is an instruction-generation model, designed to create
    valid instructions given a raw text corpus. This enables the creation of new,
    partially synthetic instruction finetuning datasets from any raw-text corpus.
    This work was inspired by Ada-Instruct and the model is also trained to generate
    questions involving complex scenarios that require detailed reasoning.
