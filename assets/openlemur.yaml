  name: Athene-Llama3-70B
  organization: The Nexusflow Team
  description: Athene-Llama3-70B is an open-weights language model trained through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). It was fine-tuned from the model Llama-3-70B-Instruct and competes on a high performance level on the Arena-Hard-Auto benchmark, which is a proxy for the Chatbot Arena.
