  model_card: https://huggingface.co/AI-MO/NuminaMath-7B-TIR
  modality: Text; Text
  analysis: The model participated in and won the first progress prize at the AI Math Olympiad (AIMO), scoring 29/50 on both public and private test sets.
  size: 7B parameters (dense)
  dependencies: [deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-base]
  training_emissions: Unknown
  training_time: Unknown
  training_hardware: 8 multi-GPU devices
  quality_control: The model underwent a two-step fine-tuning process, first on a dataset containing math problem-solution pairs, then on a synthetic dataset with examples of multi-step generations using tool-integrated reasoning.
  access: Unknown
  license: Apache 2.0
  intended_uses: The model is designed to solve math problems. It can be used to solve problems at the level of AMC 12 and occasionally harder problems at the AIME and Math Olympiad level, although it does struggle with more complex problems.
  prohibited_uses: The model is specifically designed to solve math problems and should not be used for general chat applications.
  monitoring: Unknown
  feedback: Problems should be reported through the Hugging Face repository.
