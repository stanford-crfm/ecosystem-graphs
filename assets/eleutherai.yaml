      bit of a visual redesign. Previously, clicking on a trending topic would highlight
      a story from one publication, and you’d have to scroll down past a live video
      section to view related stories. Facebook is replacing that system with a
      simple carousel, which does a better job of showing you different coverage
      options. To be clear, the change doesn’t affect how stories are sourced, according
      to Facebook. It’s still the same algorithm pickin...'

      Some of the cases with bilateral TKA are symptomatic, necessitating revision

    The Pile data come from 22 sources, with over half of the data being from

    biomedical articles (PubMed Central; 90GB), and code (Github; 95 GB).

    [[Table 1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00027.pdf#table.caption.2).
  excluded: >
    Authors report that they have excluded some datasets "because they were too
    small to be worth spending time or because the English component of the data
    did not merit inclusion on its own. Three datasets were excluded for other
    reasons: (1) US Congressional Records were excluded because it "reflects the
    opinions and biases of the political class over the past 200 years,
    including segregationism and xenophobia." (2) Online Fanfiction resources
    amounting to Hundreds of GiB were excluded on logistical grounds.
    (3) Literotica, platform where users can upload short-form erotic fiction,
    was excluded because the authors decided to exclude fanfiction, the
    corpus would require significant investigation, and corpus contain
    significant amount of stereotyping

  quality_control:

      In addition to the data inclusion and exclusion decisions, the quality was
      controlled through filtering for English (pycld2 language classifier),
      filtering for documents similar to OpenWebText2 (classifier on CommonCrawl),
      and several forms of deduplication as detailed in the paper

      which is generating text from a prompt.
