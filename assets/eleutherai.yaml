      bit of a visual redesign. Previously, clicking on a trending topic would highlight
      a story from one publication, and you’d have to scroll down past a live video
      section to view related stories. Facebook is replacing that system with a
      simple carousel, which does a better job of showing you different coverage
      options. To be clear, the change doesn’t affect how stories are sourced, according

      Some of the cases with bilateral TKA are symptomatic, necessitating revision
