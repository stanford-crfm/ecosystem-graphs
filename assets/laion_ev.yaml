  name: Re-LAION-5B
  organization: LAION e.V.
  description: Re-LAION-5B is an updated version of LAION-5B, the first web-scale,
    text-link to images pair dataset to be thoroughly cleaned of known links to
    suspected CSAM. It is an open dataset for fully reproducible research on language-vision
    learning. This model was developed in response to issues identified by the Stanford
    Internet Observatory in December 2023. The updates were made in collaboration
    with multiple organizations like the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), the Canadian
    Center for Child Protection (C3P), and Stanford Internet Observatory.

  model_card: unknown
  modality: text; image
  analysis: Re-LAION-5B aims to fix the issues as reported by Stanford Internet
    Observatory for the original LAION-5B. It is available for download in two versions,
    research and research-safe. In total, 2236 links that potentially led to inappropriate
    content were removed.
  size: 5.5B (text, image) pairs
  dependencies: [LAION-5B]
  training_emissions: Unknown
  training_time: Unknown
  training_hardware: Unknown
  quality_control: The model utilized lists of link and image hashes provided by
    partner organizations. These were used to remove inappropriate links from the
    original LAION-5B dataset to create Re-LAION-5B.
  access: open
  license: Apache 2.0
  intended_uses: Re-LAION-5B is designed for research on language-vision learning.
    It can also be used by third parties to clean existing derivatives of LAION-5B
    by generating diffs and removing all matched content from their versions.
  prohibited_uses: The dataset should not be utilized for purposes that breach legal
    parameters or ethical standards, such as dealing with illegal content.
  monitoring: unknown
  feedback: Problems with the dataset should be reported to the LAION organization.
    They have open lines for communication with their partners and the broader research
    community.
