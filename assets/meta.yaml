      \ from a photo provider and had to meet the terms of service of the photo provider.\
      \ Authors requested that all objectionable content be filtered from the images\
      \ they licensed.\n    (2) Users who observe objectionable images in the dataset\
      \ are invited to report them for removal at segment-anything@meta.com.\n  Despite\
      \ these measures, they observed that a small portion of images contain scenes\
      \ of protests or other gatherings that focus on a diverse spectrum of religious\
      \ beliefs or political opinions that may be considered offensive. The authors\

      \ Authors also discuss the following limitations of the model: \"While SAM performs\
      \ well in general, it is not perfect. It can miss fine structures, hallucinates\
      \ small disconnected components at times, and does not produce boundaries as\
      \ crisply as more computationally intensive methods that \u201Czoom-in\u201D\
      , e.g. [18]. In general, we expect dedicated interactive segmentation methods\
      \ to outperform SAM when many points are provided, e.g. [67]. Unlike these methods,\
      \ SAM is designed for generality and breadth of use rather than high IoU interactive\
      \ segmentation. Moreover, SAM can process prompts in real-time, but nevertheless\
      \ SAM's overall performance is not real-time when using a heavy image encoder.\
      \ Our foray into the text-to-mask task is exploratory and not entirely robust,\
      \ although we believe it can be improved with more effort. While SAM can perform\
      \ many tasks, it is unclear how to design simple prompts that implement semantic\
      \ and panoptic segmentation. Finally, there are domain-specific tools, such\
      \ as [7], that we expect to outperform SAM in their respective domains.\"\n"
