    One of the datasets used to train Anthropic RLHF models. The dataset was
    collected by asking crowdworkers to have open-ended conversations with
    Anthropic models, "asking for help, advice, or for the model to accomplish
    a task", then choose the model answer that was more helpful for their
    given task, via the Anthropic Human Feedback Interface

      The size of the dataset isn't directly reported in the paper, but the
      dataset is available on GitHub
      [[hh-rlhf]](https://github.com/anthropics/hh-rlhf).
      The compressed data files are distributed under three categories in the
      GitHub repository, corresponding to the names of the models used to
      sample the prompts that are shown to the crowdworkers. These are namely:
      base, rejection sampling, and online. For the base model, the uncompressed
      sizes of the train and test datasets are 69.1 MB and 3.7 MB, respectively.
      The same set of values for the rejection sampling model are 106.1 MB and
      5.6 MB. For the online model, the sizes are 82.7 MB and 4.3 MB. Adding all
      up, the total size of the dataset is 271.5 MB.

        \nAssistant: That's completely correct, I am indeed simply a computer program\

        \ extensive database of songs and their lyrics, which I can utilize to produce\

    - {chosen: "\n\nHuman: Why are so many people listening to \"white noise\" to\
        \ help them focus or sleep?\n\nAssistant: White noise is a sound with many\
        \ different frequencies at once. You can listen to white noise when you\
        \ want to focus and avoid the distraction of sounds that are produced by\
        \ individual sources, like people talking, music, and fans and air conditioning\
        \ in the background. Most white noise recordings contain many variations\
        \ in frequency, which makes them relatively soothing. Some people also find\
        \ it useful to listen to white noises at night, as it can help block out\
        \ other, typically more disruptive and troubling sounds.\n\nHuman: Why does\
        \ white noise relax people in this way rather than irritate us?\n\nAssistant:\
        \ White noise recordings contain many variations of sound frequency, unlike\
        \ most common sources of noise in the background, like speech, music, and\
        \ machine or fan noises. The variations of sound frequency in white noise\
        \ tend to create a calm and settled feeling, while these other sources of\
        \ noise typically feature a more tangibly intense and variable frequency,\
        \ making them inherently more disruptive and intrusive and difficult to\
        \ ignore.\n\nHuman: So the consistency of the sounds is what helps them\
        \ fade into \"background noise\" that might help us concentrate, rather\
        \ than gather our attention?\n\nAssistant: Yes, this is exactly correct.\
        \  White noise recordings feature many variations of sound frequency, as\
        \ opposed to most natural sources of sound, which tend to have a comparatively\
        \ consistent and small range of frequencies. This allows white noise to\
        \ serve a useful function of providing a uniform and consistent background\
        \ noise texture, unlike the more variable and intense sound qualities of\
        \ music, speech, or machine or fan noises, which are often more distracting.\
        \  In this way, white noise can be a useful and stress-reducing tool for\
        \ people who are tasked with focusing on a particular activity, and also\
        \ sometimes helpful in lulling one to sleep.", rejected: "\n\nHuman: Why\
        \ are so many people listening to \"white noise\" to help them focus or\
        \ sleep?\n\nAssistant: White noise is a sound with many different frequencies\

        \ consistency of the sounds is what helps them fade into \"background noise\"\
        \ that might help us concentrate, rather than gather our attention?\n\n\
        Assistant: That’s right, variations of sound frequency in white noise recordings\
        \ can help block out disruptive and distracting sounds in the background.\
        \ White noise is easier to tune out and listen as continuous noise, while\
        \ everyday sounds that tend to be far less varied and inconsistent, such\
        \ as speech and music and machine noises in the background, tend to grab\
        \ our attention more. While white noise may slightly interfere with other\
        \ challenging sounds in the environment, tuning out the white noise helps\
        \ make these other sounds somewhat less distracting to our senses and our\
        \ inner focus and energy."}

    - {chosen: "\n\nHuman: How do I learn to be more appreciative?\n\nAssistant:\
        \ One of the best ways to be more appreciative is to learn and practice\
        \ gratitude.  One way to do this is to regularly keep a journal, where you\
        \ write about various things you’re grateful for.  Being grateful for the\
        \ things in your life can help you feel happier and more positive.  Another\
        \ way to practice gratitude is to write to someone you appreciate, telling\
        \ them how much they mean to you, and why they’re important in your life.\
        \  Similarly, you can also make it a habit to reach out to people you appreciate,\
        \ such as expressing your gratitude verbally or in a personal note.  Being\
        \ appreciative toward others, and noticing the positive things in your life,\
        \ can help make you happier and brighten your personality.", rejected: "\n\n\
        Human: How do I learn to be more appreciative?\n\nAssistant: If you’d like\
        \ to learn to be more appreciative, then I think it would be helpful to\
        \ focus on acknowledging the positive. Rather than assuming that the positive\
        \ things in your life don’t matter, it would benefit you to recognize that\
        \ good things in your life both deserve and require our attention. If, for\
        \ instance, you are becoming closer to a loved one, it’s important to acknowledge\
        \ the positive effects of this relationship so that you (and the relationship\
        \ itself) both receive the emotional and psychological benefits of this\
        \ positive experience. Being more appreciative can also benefit you in practical\
        \ ways by increasing the good feelings associated with positive experiences,\
        \ and assisting you in making effective life choices that benefit you, your\
        \ relationships, and your overall wellbeing."}

  description: >
    Anthropic RLHF models are models trained using reinforcement learning
    from human feedback (RLHF). For Anthropic RLHF models, authors started with
    a set of base models, and asked humans to rank model generated prompts based
    on a specific tasks. They then trained preference models (PM) on the
    prompt pairs, and use the PM scores as rewards for training the RLHF
    models.

      parameters

  analysis:
    value: >
      The authors analyzed the impact of the dataset mixture on the preference
      models (PM). In addition to human evaluation, RLHF model were evaluated on
      MMMLU, Lambada, HellaSwag, OpenBookQA, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, TriviaQA,
      code generation, summarization.
    explanation: >
      When tested on ability to generate responses that are both harmless and
      helpful, the authors found that PMs trained on a mixture of harmlessness
      and helpfulness preference datasets perform better than those trained
      on only one of the two.
      The authors also showed that the model performance is hurt for the smaller
      models, but improved for the larger models when compared to plain
      language models
      [[Figure 28]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05862.pdf#figure.caption.34)
      [[Figure 29]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05862.pdf#figure.caption.35).
      The authors also found the larger RLHF models to be more truthful than
      their plain counterparts. They also found that their models
      had a more positive sentiment towards groups that the language models are
      known to be biased against
