  description: "\"Databricks’ Dolly, a large language model trained on the Databricks\n\
    \ Machine Learning Platform, demonstrates that a two-years-old open source\n\
    \ model (GPT-J) can, when subjected to just 30 minutes of fine tuning on a\n\
    \ focused corpus of 50k records (Stanford Alpaca), exhibit surprisingly\n high\
    \ quality instruction following behavior not characteristic of the\n foundation\
    \ model on which it is based.\"\n [[Dolly Repository]](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly).\n"

    \ model family is under active development, and so any list of shortcomings\
    \ is unlikely to be exhaustive, but we include known limitations and misfires\
    \ here as a means to document and share our preliminary findings with the community.\
    \ In particular, dolly-6b struggles with syntactically complex prompts, mathematical\
    \ operations, factual errors, dates and times, open-ended question answering,\
    \ hallucination, enumerating lists of specific length, and stylistic mimicry.\"\
