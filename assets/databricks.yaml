  name: DBRX
  organization: Databricks
  description: DBRX is a transformer-based decoder-only large language model (LLM) that was trained using next-token prediction by Databricks. It uses a fine-grained mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with 132B total parameters of which 36B parameters are active on any input. DBRX only accepts text-based inputs and produces text-based outputs.
