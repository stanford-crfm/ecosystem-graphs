  name: Triplex
  organization: SciPhi.AI
  description: Triplex is a state-of-the-art language model for knowledge graph construction developed by SciPhi.AI. It works by extracting triplets - simple statements consisting of a subject, predicate, and object - from text or other data sources to build knowledge graphs. It offers a practical solution for building local knowledge graphs and reduces costs by 98%, outperforming GPT-4 at 1/60th the cost.
