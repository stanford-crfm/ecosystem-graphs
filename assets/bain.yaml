  name: XEUS
  organization: Carnegie Mellon University's WAVLab
  description: XEUS is a large-scale multilingual speech encoder that was pre-trained on over 1 million hours of publicly available speech datasets and covers over 4000 languages. It requires fine-tuning to be used in downstream tasks such as Speech Recognition or Translation and also supports Flash Attention. Its hidden states can also be used with k-means for semantic Speech Tokenization. XEUS uses the E-Branchformer architecture and is trained using HuBERT-style masked prediction of discrete speech tokens extracted from WavLabLM. During training, the input speech is also augmented with acoustic noise and reverberation.

  modality: Audio; Text
  analysis: XEUS tops the ML-SUPERB multilingual speech recognition leaderboard, outperforming others such as MMS, w2v-BERT 2.0, and XLS-R. It also sets a new state-of-the-art on 4 tasks in the monolingual SUPERB benchmark.
