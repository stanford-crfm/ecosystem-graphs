  description: Conformer-1 is a state-of-the-art speech recognition model trained
    on 650K hours of audio data that achieves near human-level performance and robustness
    across a variety of data, making up to 43% fewer errors on noisy data than other
    ASR models.

    explanation: See [[Results and Performance]](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/conformer-1/#results-and-performance)
    value: In order to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of Conformer-1, we sourced
      60+ hours of human labeled audio data covering popular speech domains such
      as call centers, podcasts, broadcasts, and webinars. We then calculated the
      Word Error Rate (WER) of Conformer-1 against these datasets, and compared
      the results against Whisper and a number of other ASR models. To ground our
      results against popular open source speech recognition benchmarks, we also
      performed the same WER analysis against a number of academic datasets.
