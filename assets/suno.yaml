  name: Gen-3 Alpha
  organization: Runway AI, Inc.
  description: Gen-3 Alpha is the first of an upcoming series of models trained by Runway on a new infrastructure built for large-scale multimodal training. It represents a major improvement in fidelity, consistency, and motion over the previous Gen-2 model. Trained on both videos and images, Gen-3 Alpha demonstrates high-fidelity, controllable video generation capabilities.
