  name: ESM3
  organization: EvolutionaryScale
  description: ESM3 is a breakthrough language model for the life sciences designed to program and simulate the code of life. It is the first generative model for biology that simultaneously reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. It is trained on billions of proteins from diverse environments and is capable of understanding the underlying principles of biology due to its large-scale training. The model has marked a milestone in creating a completely new green fluorescent protein. It can generate new proteins by responding to prompts, thereby offering an unparalleled degree of control over protein production.
