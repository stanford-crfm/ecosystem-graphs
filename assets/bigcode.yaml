  intended_uses: The model was trained on GitHub code. As such it is not an instruction
    model and commands do not work well. You should phrase commands like they occur
    in source code such as comments or write a function signature and docstring
    and let the model complete the function body.

  intended_uses: The model was trained on GitHub code as well as additional selected
    data sources such as Arxiv and Wikipedia. As such it is not an instruction model
    and commands like "Write a function that computes the square root." do not work
    well. Intended to generate code snippets from given context, but not for writing
    actual functional code directly.

    code from 17 programming languages. The predominant language in source is English
    although other languages are also present. As such the model is capable of generating
    code snippets provided some context but the generated code is not guaranteed
    to work as intended. It can be inefficient and contain bugs or exploits. See
