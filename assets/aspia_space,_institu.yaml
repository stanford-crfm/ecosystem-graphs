  description: AstroPT is an autoregressive pretrained transformer developed with
    astronomical use-cases in mind. The models have been pretrained on 8.6 million
    512x512 pixel grz-band galaxy postage stamp observations from the DESI Legacy
    Survey DR8. They have created a range of models with varying complexity, ranging
    from 1 million to 2.1 billion parameters.

  model_card: unknown
  modality: Image; Image (The model takes an image as input and processes it to
    provide insights)
  analysis: The models’ performance on downstream tasks was evaluated by linear
    probing. The models follow a similar saturating log-log scaling law to textual
    models, their performance improves with the increase in model size up to the
    saturation point of parameters.
  size: Ranges from 1 million to 2.1 billion parameters.
  dependencies: [DESI Legacy Survey DR8]
  training_emissions: Unknown
  training_time: Unknown
  training_hardware: Unknown
  quality_control: The models’ performances were evaluated on downstream tasks as
    measured by linear probing.
  access: open
  license: MIT
  intended_uses: The models are intended for astronomical use-cases, particularly
    in handling and interpreting large observation data from astronomical sources.
  prohibited_uses: Unknown
  monitoring: Unknown
  feedback: Any problem with the model can be reported to Michael J. Smith at mike@mjjsmith.com.
