      The authors use simple heuristics for filtering low quality documents as
      opposed to relying on a classifier based on a "gold" set such as the English
      Wikipedia, which could "inadvertently bias towards a certain demographic or
      erase certain dialects or sociolects from representation." MassiveWeb
      subset was filtered using Google’s SafeSearch filter, preferring it over
      to word filters that "disproportinately filter out inoffensive content
      associated with minority groups. MassiveWeb was filtered
      further for word or phrase repetitions. All the subsets were filtered for
      document deduplication and test set contamination"

      [[Model Card]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=1ikK0kHjvj#appendix.A).
  intended_uses:
    value: >
      The intended uses are stated in the Gopher model card: "Learn to accomplish
      a wide variety of tasks from expert demonstrations, such as playing video
      games, controlling simulated embodiments,
      and real world block stacking."
      [[Model Card]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=1ikK0kHjvj#appendix.A).
  prohibited_uses:
    value: >
      The model card lists the following as out of scope uses of the model: "Not
      intended for commercial or production use. Military uses are
      strictly prohibited."
