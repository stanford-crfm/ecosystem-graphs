      MassiveText data was analyzed for toxicity, language distribution, URL
      breakdown, and tokenizer compression rates on the subsets

  included: >
    MassiveText data come from 6 sources: MassiveWeb (48%), Books (27%),
    C4 (10%), News (10%), GitHub (3%), and Wikipedia (2%). MassiveWeb is a
    web text corpus curated for MassiveText.
  excluded: >
    Documents that are not in English are excluded.
  quality_control:
    value: >
      The authors use simple heuristics for filtering low quality documents as
      opposed to relying on a classifier based on a "gold" set such as the English
      Wikipedia, which could "inadvertently bias towards a certain demographic or
      erase certain dialects or sociolects from representation." MassiveWeb
      subset was filtered using Google’s SafeSearch filter, preferring it over
      to word filters that "disproportinately filter out inoffensive content
      associated with minority groups. MassiveWeb was filtered
      further for word or phrase repetitions. All the subsets were filtered for
      document deduplication and test set contamination

      There are no known prohibited uses of the dataset, but the authors
      state that it should not be used for training models with multilingual
      capabilities as it only contains the English language

  name: Gopher
  # General
  organization: DeepMind
  description: >
    Gopher is an autoregressive large language model based on the Transformer
    architecture with two modifications: using RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm and
    using relative positional encoding scheme instead of absolute positional
    encodings

      Gopher family has models of several sizes, but the name
      Gopher uniquely identify the 280B parameter version. Sizes for the other
      models in the Gopher family can be seen in the paper

      Model performance was evaluated and analyzed on 152 NLP tasks including:

  intended_uses:
    value: >
      The intended uses are stated in the Gopher model card: "The primary use is
      research on language models, including: research on NLP applications like
      machine translation and question answering, understanding how strong
      language models can contribute to AGI, advancing fairness and safety
      research, and understanding limitations of current LLMs"

  prohibited_uses:
    value: >
      The model card lists the following as out of scope uses of the model: "for
      language generation in harmful or deceitful settings. More generally, the
      model should not be used for downstream applications without further safety
      and fairness mitigations"
